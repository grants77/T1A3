## Requirements

Below are the dependencies and system/hardware requirements for the use of this application.

### Dependencies

The following Python libraries are used in this application. You are not required to install them yourself as they will do so when you run the scripts from the above user instructions.

- **colored:** A simple library for the colouring and formatting in the terminal application.

- **maskpass:** A library which in this instance is used to mask the password of the user when they are either logging into the application or creating an account.

- **random:** This is used for two purposes in the application - For the generation of a random UserID when the user registers for the first time, and to randomly sort the examination questions to present to the user.

- **datetime:** This is used to record the date and time of the user at the time they completed their examination. It is retained and displayed when viewing the users previous results.

### System/Hardware

This application is not resource intensive and will run with minimal hardware specs. There are some software requirements as per below.

- Python3
- Bash
- Git

## Features

The following features are displayed within the application for the user to navigate to and interact with:

- **Login:** The user is able to login to the application with a username and password which is stored in a **exam_users.csv** file. This allows the user to have a personalised experience when they are in the application and allow for potentially sensitive information to be stored and not displayed by the application to other users.

- **Registration:** The application checks the users email address in the **exam_users.csv** file and if the user is not registered it prompts for their personal details and stores them in the file, allowing that user to login with those details if they return to the system.

- **Examination:** The user is able to select the 'Take New Exam' option from the provided menu. This takes the user to the examination screen which will prompt the user to answer 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' to ten randomly selected questions from the **exam_questions.csv** file. The user can gracefully exit from the exam by entering 'EXIT'. For testing/marking purposes, if the question ends with an 'F' it is false, otherwise it is true.

- **Previous Results:** The application allows the user to view all of their previous exam attempts by accessing the **exam_results.csv** file and only returning the results for the user that is logged into the application. The results on this file are recorded at the end of the exam whether the user passes or fails.

- **Personal Profile:** The user can select the personal profile option from the menu which will present a screen with the information they provided on registration. This screen will also display if the user is accredited by displaying 'TRUE'. This accreditation is updated by the application if the user achieves a score of 80% or more in an exam. The information on this screen is derived from the **exam_users.csv** file.

- **Logout:** This allows the user to log out of the application without terminating the script, so they can log into another account.

## Implementaton Plan

I created and maintained a Trello KanBan for the planning and implimentation of the application. Unfortunately I was sick for the majority of the project so it was not entirely kept up to date. Below is a screenshot of the Trello board on 5 May 2024 and a link to the live public board.
